Challenge to code basic blackjack in 45 minutes

Original prompt:
Programmer friends, do you think you could implement a basic game of blackjack (no bets, no splits, no doubling down, ace is low, draw until you stay or bust, one human player and one computer dealer) in 45 minutes?

Status:
I was personally unable to finish the whole game loop in 45 minutes, but have since gone back to finish it and continue to clean up the code and add new features.
